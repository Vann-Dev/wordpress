# Custom Image WordPress Ver 6.4.2
___

## Why?
- This is an image made with [wordpress:6.4.2](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/wordpress/6.4.2/images/sha256-78a32485432b3bc0ff474fc537037db31ba12a119f12db859a682dc7851265b0?context=explore)
- What's the different? I added max upload size for plugins, so people don't need to edit `uploads.ini` inside WordPress
- What will come next? I think I will add more custom configurations to the image
